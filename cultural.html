        <hr>
        <p>The palace was given to the Egyptian nation in 1955. Prince Muhammad Ali is the first cousin of King
          Faruq and the younger brother of Khedive Abbas II Hilmi. The complex consists of six structures.
          Among these structures is a museum in which Faruq's hunting trophies are found, the prince's
          residence and furnishings and a museum in which some of the family's memorabilia are found. There
          are also gardens that have beautiful plants and flowers that are worth seeing. The palace also
          includes a collection of manuscripts, carpets, textiles, brass work and crystal. On part of the
          original grounds a hotel has been built called the Meridian Hotel.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>It was barely more than a legend. Appearing in a few rare inscriptions and ancient texts, the city of
          Thonis-Heracleion was hidden away for thousands of years, submerged deep under the sea. After
          searching for years by screening the vast area of the Abu Qir Bay off the coast of Egypt,
          Thonis-Heracleion was encountered, completely submerged 6.5 kilometres off Alexandria’s
          coast. Among the underwater ruins were 64 ships, 700 anchors, a treasure trove of gold coins,
          statues standing at 16 feet, and most notably the remains of a massive temple to the god Amun-Gereb,
          and the tiny sarcophagi for the animals that were brought there as offerings.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Particularly popular among students of Islamic art and history, the Gayer Anderson museum is located
          near Ibn Tulun Mosque in Sayyida Zeinab. It is composed of two adjoining houses which were erected
          in 1540 and 1631 during the Ottoman period. Various families lived in the houses, namely John Gayer
          Anderson, a British major and army doctor who resided in the house from 1935 to 1942 after
          receiving special permission from the Egyptian government while he was on assignment in Egypt.
          Through his travels in the region, Anderson collected artwork, carpets, antiquities and curious
          furniture which he kept in the houses.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Bab al Futuh (Conquest Gate) is one of three remaining gates in the walls of the Old City of Cairo,
          Egypt. It was finished in the year 1087 and faces north. It stands at the northern end of Muizz
          Street. The other two remaining gates are Bab al-Nasr in the North and Bab Zuwayla in the south.
          The gate was part of fortification built by Vizier Badr Al-Jamali of Fatimid Imam
          Mustansir. Its rounded towers were a stronger defense than the square towers of Bab al-Nasr. They
          had shafts for pouring boiling water or burning oil on
          attackers, and arrow slits. The gate is covered in vegetal and geometric motifs.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Known for it’s beautiful weather, colorful architecture and kind people, Nubia is much more of a
          charm once you get to know the culture, meet the people and experience their traditions. Ride a Nile
          Felucca to the pretty Nubian islands of Heissa, and Gharb Soheil, stroll through the
          markets, and the beautifully painted Nubian houses and meet the locals. Other than the activities
          and the beautiful Nile view, you could actually spend some time with the natives. The Nubians whom
          are not just kind, but actually very interesting people with many stories about their history and
          their present to share with you as an Egyptian or a tourist; they just love socializing.
