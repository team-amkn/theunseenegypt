        <hr>
        <p>Siwa Oasis has got many springs, they are being used as environmental treatment place, and the water
          is capable of curing some diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatism and some digestive system diseases.
          The most famous spring is the Kegar well; the temperature of its water is 67-degree Celsius.
          Scientific research proved that the water contains amounts of minerals similar to that found in the
          water of the springs of Carlo Vefari the famous Health Center which tourists visit to have
          their treatment.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Oyun Musa is one of Egypt’s hot springs; renowned for the therapeutic effects of its water, the
          destination has made Sinai popular for therapeutic tourism.
          Located 250 kilometers from Cairo and stretching one kilometer along the Gulf of Suez, the location
          of Oyun Musa is blessed with a dry climate and golden sands.
          Oyun Musa boasts the world’s highest sulfur rates, and with temperatures reaching up to 27 degrees
          Celsius, the water helps treat many diseases such as those of the kidneys and skin. </p>

        <hr>
        <p>Located on the road to Sharm El Sheikh, the Pharaoh’s Bath is a natural source of water that comes
          through caves inside the mountains. The sulfuric water springs lining the seashore produce
          significant quantities of water with temperatures as high as 92 degrees Celsius. The springs are
          said to treat, or at the very least help
          alleviate rheumatism of all kinds, including rheumatoid arthritis, liver disease, skin diseases,
          gastrointestinal diseases and kidney disease among other things.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>This one is already quite known, but no hot springs list is complete without it. Among Siwa’s many
          natural treasures is this one. While sources are divided on whether or not the
          queen herself swam there, we’d like to believe it’s where she took her well-deserved vacations from
          running a dynasty. The stone pool is said to have been where local brides used to bathe. The local
          brides have now unfortunately moved to another, more secluded area, Tamusi bath. Apparently the
          algae in the spring is good for the skin too</p>

        <hr>
        <p>It is a newly man made cave made entirely of salt brought from Siwa Oasis and the Dead Sea. Charged
          with iodine, bromine, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium and potassium, the salt cave is the first
          natural healing centre in Egypt. The exceptional microclimate created by a ceiling that has gorgeous
          salt stalactites and a floor covered with salt crystals revitalizes your strength and beauty while
          colour schemes and lighting designed by color therapy experts create a natural calming of the
          senses.

        <div class="item-title">Safaga</div>
        <hr>
        <p>Safaga city is the number one destination in Egypt for the treatment of psoriasis. It is located
          south of Hurghada on the Red Sea. Here in Safaga the sea water is very salty, containing 35%
          more salt than other seas: treatment with this water can produce a big improvement in the
          circulatory system, thus increasing the flow of blood to the limbs and skin. The water has been
          shown to provide significant alleviation for sufferers from psoriasis and the high density of
          ultraviolet rays in the area also helps cure a number of other skin diseases.
