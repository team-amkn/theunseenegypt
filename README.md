A simple website created in plain HTML, CSS and JS as a university project in BUE ICS Prep. Year.
___
## Brief Description
We offer recommendations and information about the beauty of Egypt, putting the spotlight on the places that are not getting the deserved attention. We also offer recommendations for hotels, restaurants, and a simple guide on what to choose when moving around in Egypt.

A dark orange-gold color scheme has been chosen in order to match the colors of ancient Egypt. Readability was taken into consideration by making well use of colors to have the required contrast (dark background and light text). There is also a translucent effect due to the use of opacity across different objects on the website. Moreover, a focus effect has been used to highlight a specific card when hovering (Places and Hotels web pages).
