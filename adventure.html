                <div class="item-title">Wadi El Wesh Wash</div>
                <hr>
                <p>On your way to South Sinai, Wadi al-Wesh Wash is situated near Ras Shitan Camp, just a short 15
                    kilometers away from Nuweiba. It is buried deep into the mountains of South Sinai, where the
                    mountains contain granite. It is basically earning the swim
                    because getting there is a
                    workout (so be prepared to exert some effort before reaching your destination). To get to the
                    lake,
                    you walk around two kilometers until you reach the mountains. Once there, you climb the
                    mountains
                    and at some point you'll be climbing it with a rope for around two to three kilometers. Now that
                    the
                    hard part is over, you'll get to indulge in a beautiful secluded lake. The lake itself is made
                    up of
                    rain water. You can even jump off one of the lower mountains and into the water.</p>

                <div class="item-title">The Blue Hole</div>
                <hr>
                <p>The Blue Hole in the Red Sea just north of Dahab, Egypt, is known as the “Diver’s Cemetery” for
                    the
                    staggering number of intrepid swimmers who perished in its depths. It is a submarine sinkhole,
                    with
                    a maximum depth within the hole of just over 100m. There is a shallow opening to the sea around
                    6m
                    deep, known as "the saddle", and a 26m long tunnel, known as "the arch", whose top is at a depth
                    of
                    55m, and whose bottom falls away as it reaches the seaward side to about 120m. On the seaward
                    side
                    the depth drops steeply to over a thousand metres deep. The hole and the surrounding area have
                    an
                    abundance of coral and reef fish. The Blue Hole is a hot spot for freediving because of the
                    depth
                    directly accessible from shore and the lack of current.</p>

                <div class="item-title">The Colored Canyon</div>
                <hr>
                <p>Coloured Canyon is a rock formation on Sinai peninsula. It is a labyrinth of rocks, some of them have
                    about 40 meters. The canyon is almost 800 meters long. The nearest town to the canyon is Nuweiba. It
                    is about 90 km north of Dahab. One of Egypt’s most beautiful hikes, equally enjoyed by hikers, and
                    outdoors enthusiasts.
                    Trekking
                    the Colored Canyon starts at Ain Furtaga Oasis where hikers shade themselves under leafy palm
                    trees,
                    it takes a couple of hours of strolling through the serpentine path that was made due to high
                    iron
                    content in the sandstone, wind and water erosion creating a breath-taking spectrum of colors,
                    with a
                    bit of climbing that doesn’t require any previous experience, only a passion for adventure.</p>

            <div class="place-grid-item">

                <div class="item-title">Djara Cave</div>
                <hr>
                <p>It is located in the middle of the Western Desert, on a limestone plateau, next to an old camel
                    track
                    connecting Farafra and Assiut. The cave is easy to visit. Many parts have a level floor covered
                    by
                    the sand of the desert.
                    Light is required and a helmet is a good idea too. The cave is also special for its cave art,
                    engravings depicting game and people. They were made during the Holocene wet phase, when this
                    area
                    was occupied by early
                    hunters and gatherers.</p>

                <div class="item-title">Africa Safari Park</div>
                <hr>
                <p>Experience the loveliest forest activity surrounded by nature and animals in open woods. The park
                    consists of 22 types of rare reptiles
                    which are canvassed by a cave. The cave
                    features a gathering of reptiles, birds, and some rare species of animals. Nothing to worry
                    about as
                    the most unsafe of them are securely kept in glass cases. One of the most enjoyable activities
                    here
                    is the ‘Zambezi’
                    river excursion that takes you out to view crocodiles, monkeys and a lot of birds e-route. </p>

            <div class="place-grid-item">
                <img src="assets/img/adventure/6.jpg" alt="An image showcasing The Black Desert">
                <div class="item-title">The Black Desert</div>
                <hr>
                <p>One of the beautiful attractions of the Black Desert is Pyramid Mountain, a relief form that
                    shoots
                    up
                    from the ground much like pyramids out of the desert
                    Locals call it
                    Magic Mountain because of the way the light plays on the texture and material of the mountain
                    during
                    the different hours of the day. The golden colour of this rock is very attractive, especially in
                    the
                    later
                    afternoon sun. If you take the challenge to climb this mountain, which takes about one hour, the
                    top
                    will
                    surprise you with an impressive view over the oasis, the desert and thousands of palm trees.
