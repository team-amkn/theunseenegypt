        <hr>
        <p>The small village of Tunis is located in the oasis of Fayoum, on the way to Wadi Al-Rayan. Located on a
          hill
          facing a large salt water lake, the village overlooks a stunning view of the edge of the desert on the other
          side of the lake. It is one of the most beautiful places in Egypt as it offers many activities such as horse
          riding, bird watching and pottery classes. The Perfect way to get around Tunis village is on bicycle. Tunis

        <div class="item-title">Fjord Bay</div>
        <hr>
        <p>This slice of heaven is located on the Taba-Nuweiba road. Fjord Bay is made up of crystal waters, stunning
          coral reefs, and is surrounded by mountains. If you prefer being on land at all times, then leave the beach
          and the divers by the sea and climb the mountain to take in the natural beauty from up top. This
          spot is good for big groups who are undecided on what they want to do, as there's something for everyone.
          Whether you'd rather lounge around and work on your tan, or take a hike, explore a
          little or discover history with the Salahdin fortress being a boat trip away, it's all there. There's also
          camping spots if you don't feel like driving back to the hotel.</p>

        <div class="item-title">Ras Banas</div>
        <hr>
        <p>Marsa Alam is famous for its natural beauty and its gorgeous beaches. Near the border of Sudan, Ras Banas
          is
          a great snorkeling and diving spot. The natural beauty is perfect for getting in your weekly dose of
          meditation, as it's quite the serene getaway. The beach is known for its clear blue waters and its
          breath-taking corals. It offers a delightful adventure to divers, and a pleasant experience for swimmers who
          want to enjoy watching coral reefs and colorful fish through its clear waters without going the extra mile,
          hence “diving or snorkeling”.</p>

        <div class="item-title">Wadi Qalaan</div>
        <hr>
        <p>Located in Wadi El Gemal, Wadi Qulaan has a few activities if you’re an outdoorsy person and prefer the
          company of animals (which we can't blame you for). In between your swimming by the mangroves and tanning
          sessions, you could catch up on your bird watching or chill in Gabal Hamata, which is home to Ibex and
          gazelles. This is more of
          a
          quiet destination, made up of several breathtaking areas surrounded by beautiful scenery. </p>

        <div class="item-title">Marsa Mubarak</div>
        <hr>
        <p>Marsa Mubarak, also known as Turtle Bay, is home to dugongs, which were listed by the International Union
          for
          Conservation of Nature as vulnerable. Dugongs are only found in three areas
          across Egypt, one of which is Marsa Mubarak. So if you’re looking for a new swimming or diving partner,
          you’ll find quite a few dugongs and turtles around.
          Located in Marsa Alam, it’s a nice change from the usually overcrowded beaches we find in other seaside
          spots. You may also run into dolphins! While you can chill by the beach, Marsa Mubarak is popular mainly
          for
          diving and snorkeling.</p>
